# Project Brief: PI Planner

## Core Mission
PI Planner is a single-page HTML web application designed for Program Increment (PI) Planning in Agile environments. It provides a clean, intuitive interface to help teams organize, visualize, and manage tasks, sprints, epics, and dependencies within a PI. The app enables efficient sprint board management, roadmap visualization via Gantt charts, and settings configuration, all with local storage persistence for offline use.

## Key Objectives
- Facilitate Kanban-style task assignment and drag-and-drop reorganization across sprints and backlog.
- Offer visual timeline planning through a Gantt-based roadmap view.
- Support data import/export via XLSX for easy sharing and backup.
- Ensure quick setup for new users with guided initial data population.
- Maintain simplicity: No backend required; runs directly in the browser.

This tool targets Agile teams conducting PI planning sessions, reducing planning time and improving visibility into capacity and dependencies.
