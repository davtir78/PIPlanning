    <h2>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h2>
    <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
    <h4>Personal Data (Local Storage)</h4>
    <p>PI Planner is a client-side application. This means all data you input into the application (such as sprints, tasks, epics, etc.) is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage on your Device. We do not collect, transmit, or store this data on our servers. This data remains entirely under your control on your Device.</p>
    <p>While using Our Service, You are not required to provide Us with any personally identifiable information that is transmitted to or stored by Us on a server. Any "Personal Data" mentioned in this policy primarily refers to the data you create and manage within the application, which resides solely on your Device.</p>

    <h4>Usage Data (Third-Party Services)</h4>
    <p>Usage Data is collected automatically by certain third-party services integrated into the Service. This data is not collected or stored by Us directly.</p>
    <p>Usage Data may include information such as Your Device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that You visit, the time and date of Your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data. This information is typically collected by web servers and advertising platforms for operational and analytical purposes.</p>

    <h3>Information from Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>The PI Planner application is a static web application that primarily stores data locally in your browser's local storage. We do not collect or store your personal data on our servers directly. However, we utilize third-party services that may collect information as part of their operations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Firebase Hosting:</strong> Our website is hosted on Firebase Hosting, a service provided by Google. Firebase Hosting may collect standard web server logs, including IP addresses, browser types, and access times, for operational purposes such as security, performance monitoring, and debugging. This data is handled according to Google's <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Ezoic:</strong> We use Ezoic to manage and optimize advertising on our website. Ezoic may collect and process data, including personal data, to serve personalized ads, analyze ad performance, and improve user experience. This may involve the use of cookies and other tracking technologies. For more information on Ezoic's data practices, please refer to Ezoic's <a href="https://www.ezoic.com/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Other Third-Party Libraries/CDNs:</strong> We use various third-party libraries and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for functionalities like sorting (SortableJS), Markdown rendering (Marked.js), Gantt charts (DHTMLX Gantt), and XLSX import/export (SheetJS). These services may collect anonymous usage data or log access to their resources. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for details.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Use of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>The Company does not directly use or process Your Personal Data (data stored locally on Your Device) for any purposes beyond providing the core functionality of the application within Your browser. Any "Usage Data" collected by third-party services is used by those services for their stated purposes, as outlined in their respective privacy policies.</p>
    <p>The Company may use aggregated and anonymized data derived from third-party analytics (if any are implemented) for purposes such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>To provide and maintain our Service, including to monitor the general usage patterns of our Service.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>For data analysis, identifying general usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and to evaluate and improve our Service, products, and your experience.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>The Company does not disclose Your Personal Data (data stored locally on Your Device) to any third parties, as it is not collected or stored by Us. Any data disclosure is handled directly by the third-party services you interact with (e.g., Ezoic, Firebase Hosting) according to their own privacy policies.</p>
    <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose aggregated, non-personally identifiable data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).</p>

    <h3>Retention of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>Your Personal Data (data you input into the application) is retained locally in your browser's local storage for as long as you choose to keep it there. We do not retain this data on our servers.</p>
    <p>Usage Data collected by third-party services is retained according to their respective privacy policies.</p>

    <h3>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>Your Personal Data (data you input into the application) is not transferred by Us, as it resides solely on your Device. Any data transfer related to your use of the Service occurs directly between your Device and the third-party services (e.g., Firebase Hosting, Ezoic) according to their own data transfer policies.</p>

    <h3>Delete Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>Since Your Personal Data (data you input into the application) is stored locally on Your Device, you have full control over its deletion.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>You can delete all application data by using the "Clear All Data" function available in the "Danger Zone" section of the application's Settings tab.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>You can also clear your browser's local storage for our website through your browser settings.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For data collected by third-party services (e.g., Ezoic, Firebase Hosting), please refer to their respective privacy policies for information on how to manage or delete your data with them.</p>

    <h3>Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>The security of Your Personal Data (data stored locally on Your Device) relies on the security of Your Device and browser. While we strive to ensure the application itself does not introduce vulnerabilities, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of data stored on Your Device. We recommend keeping your operating system and browser up to date and using strong security practices.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data through the application (e.g., by inputting it into local storage), please be aware that this data resides on Your Device. If We become aware that any third-party service has collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We will take steps to address it with that service.</p>

    <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.</p>
    <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
