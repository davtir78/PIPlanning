**Responsiveness of Welcome Modal:**
- Added media queries to `public/style.css` to improve the responsiveness of the welcome modal on smaller screens.
- Adjusted `max-width` and `padding` for `.modal-container` within the media query.
- Reduced font sizes for `h1` and `.subtitle` within the welcome modal for mobile views.

**Welcome Modal Wizard Implementation:**
- Refactored `public/js/ui/welcomeModal.js` to transform the welcome page into a multi-step wizard.
- Implemented `_renderWelcomeStep`, `_renderChoiceStep`, `_renderQuickSetupStep`, and `_renderImportStep` functions to manage content for each wizard step.
- Added navigation logic (`_showStep`, `_goNext`, `_goBack`) and dynamic event listener attachment (`_attachStepListeners`).
- The wizard now guides the user through an initial welcome message, a choice between quick setup or data import, and then presents the relevant form/buttons based on their selection.

**Bug Fix: `InvalidCharacterError` in Welcome Modal:**
- Fixed an `InvalidCharacterError` occurring in `public/js/ui/welcomeModal.js` due to incorrect parameter passing to the `createElement` utility function.
- Ensured that `null` is explicitly passed for the `attributes` parameter when only `textContent` is provided, aligning with the `createElement` function's signature.

**Welcome Modal Button Sizing:**
- Modified `public/style.css` to ensure consistent sizing for all buttons within the welcome modal.
- Applied `max-width: 250px;` and `width: 100%;` with `margin: auto;` to buttons within `.modal-container` (excluding footer buttons).
- Configured `.modal-container .option-section` to use flexbox (`display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;`) to center buttons and their associated text.
- Restored `flex: 1 1 0%;` for `.modal-footer .btn` to ensure "Back" and "Continue" buttons maintain equal width.
- Increased `max-width` of `.modal-container` to `550px` and added `min-width: 100px;` to `.modal-footer .btn` to prevent button cutoff.

**Welcome Modal Wizard Flow Improvement:**
- Removed the redundant "Continue" button from the "Getting Started" (choice) step in the welcome modal wizard by introducing a `showNextButton` property in the `steps` array within `public/js/ui/welcomeModal.js`.
- The `_showStep` function now conditionally renders the "Next" button based on this property, streamlining the user flow.
- Embedded the "Continue" button directly into the `_renderWelcomeStep()` function and added corresponding event listener in `_attachStepListeners()` to ensure proper rendering and functionality on the first wizard step.

**Performance Optimization: Asynchronous Script Loading:**
- Moved advertising and consent management scripts (`gatekeeperconsent.com` and `ezojs.com`) from the `<head>` to just before the closing `</body>` tag in `public/index.html`.
- Added `defer` attribute to `gatekeeperconsent.com` scripts to ensure they load asynchronously and execute after HTML parsing, improving initial page load performance.
- Fixed `net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` error for `ezojs.com` script by explicitly adding `https://` protocol to its `src` attribute in `public/index.html`.
