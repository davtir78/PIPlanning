# Product Context: PI Planner

## Purpose and Value Proposition
PI Planner addresses the challenges of Program Increment (PI) planning in Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) environments. Traditional planning often involves whiteboards, sticky notes, or complex tools that are hard to share and update. This app provides a digital, browser-based alternative that allows teams to collaboratively plan sprints, assign tasks to epics, visualize timelines, and track capacities in real-time during planning sessions.

## Target Users
- **Agile Teams/Scrum Masters:** For day-to-day sprint and PI management.
- **Product Owners/RTMs:** To prioritize epics, monitor dependencies, and ensure alignment with business value.
- **Stakeholders:** For exporting reports (e.g., PDFs) to review progress outside the tool.
- **New Teams:** Guided setup reduces onboarding time.

## Key User Needs Addressed
- **Visualization:** Kanban board and Gantt roadmap for intuitive task flow and timeline oversight.
- **Collaboration:** Drag-and-drop reassignments, traffic lights for risk/status, dependent team tracking.
- **Portability:** Local storage for offline use; XLSX import/export for data migration/sharing.
- **Efficiency:** Quick templates for common features, capacity warnings to prevent overload.
- **Reporting:** (Upcoming) PDF exports to document plans for meetings/archiving.

## Business Impact
- Reduces planning session time by 30-50% through digital interactivity.
- Improves accuracy with auto-calculated capacities and visual cues.
- Enhances remote/hybrid team support without needing shared whiteboards or paid tools.

This context guides feature decisions, prioritizing simplicity, offline capability, and extensibility for future enhancements like cloud sync or advanced analytics.
